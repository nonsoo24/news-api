This is a Frontend Developer Challenge for AIBox System. In this challenge the following was expected:
- Users should log in before they can access your news portal
- Login details should be saved in local storage to allow seamless login only from the client side.
-  News should be rendered in card view by default but give users the option to switch between a list and a card view
- The latest news should always be fetched from news api and all the values in the JSON returned from news api must be used in the card to display the news item after a user logs in
- When a user scrolls to the bottom, do ensure to fetch more content (older content)
